Simulation of PWM Control Using GTO Switches with Bipolar and Unipolar Voltage Switching Methods
To provide the initial DC voltage, we used an ideal voltage source. The power switches are GTOs without snubber circuits. We measured and plotted the output voltage, sinusoidal reference, sawtooth wave, and output current.

The sinusoidal voltage is generated by a source with variable amplitude (0.416 to 2 V) and frequency (50 to 140 Hz). The sawtooth wave is created by a generator with a variable frequency (2000 to 20000 Hz) to observe the effect of frequency variation on the output.

We used interpolated firing pulses to control the switching times, with GTOs selected in the settings.

PWM Bipolar Voltage Switching: The sinusoidal reference is compared with the sawtooth wave, and the outputs of two comparators are cross-connected to the switch gate controllers.

PWM Unipolar Voltage Switching: A second sinusoidal reference with a 180Â° phase shift was added. Each leg is controlled independently based on its own comparator (sinusoidal vs. sawtooth).

FFT analysis was used to observe the harmonic content of the output voltage. At the same switching frequency, the unipolar method showed lower output ripple compared to the bipolar method.
